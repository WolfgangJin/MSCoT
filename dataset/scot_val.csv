Output: a list of the three most frequent words in lexicographically ascending order if they have the same frequency
1: Convert paragraph to lowercase to make the solution case-insensitive
2: Use regex to remove all non-alphabetic characters from the paragraph
3: Split the cleaned paragraph into words
4: Initialize an empty dictionary named word_count_dict to store word frequencies
5: for each word in the list of words:
6:     if word is not in word_count_dict:
7:         add word to word_count_dict with a count of 1
8:     else:
9:         increment the count of word by 1
10: Create a list of tuples from word_count_dict sorted by frequency in descending order and then by lexicographical order
11: Initialize an empty list named top_three_words
12: for i from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
13:     if i is less than the length of the sorted list:
14:         add the word from the tuple at index i to top_three_words
15: return top_three_words"

Input: dictionary: a dictionary with keys of various data types (numeric, strings, tuples)
Output: the key that is the supremum in the dictionary, determined by lexicographical order
1: Initialize a variable supremum_key to None
2: for each key in dictionary:
3:     if supremum_key is None:
4:         set supremum_key to current key
5:     else:
6:         compare current key with supremum_key:
7:             if current key is greater than supremum_key:
8:                 set supremum_key to current key
9: return supremum_key

Explanation of branches and loops:
- Loop through each key in the dictionary to check and compare.
- Branches inside the loop to determine if the current key should replace the current supremum_key based on comparison."
