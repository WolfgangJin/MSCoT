"Let's think step by step
Input: number0: a positive integer (1 <= number0 <= 1000)
Output: a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase
1: Initialize a dictionary named roman_numerals with integer keys and string values for Roman numeral mappings
2: Initialize an empty result string named result
3: for each numeral in roman_numerals from largest to smallest:
4:     while number0 is greater than or equal to numeral:
5:         append the corresponding Roman numeral string to result
6:         subtract numeral from number0
7: return result in lowercase"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a, b, c: lengths of the three sides of a triangle
Output: boolean: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Identify the largest of the three sides, as it could potentially be the hypotenuse
2: Assign the largest side to variable hypotenuse, and the other two to side1 and side2
3: Calculate the square of the hypotenuse
4: Calculate the sum of the squares of side1 and side2
5: if the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of side1 and side2:
6:     return True
7: else:
8:     return False"
"Let's think step by step
Input: s: a string
Output: a transformed string based on specific rules
1: Initialize an empty result string named result
2: Initialize a boolean flag hasLetters to false
3: for each character ch in s:
4:     if ch is a letter:
5:         set hasLetters to true

Input: text: a string
Output: an md5 hash equivalent string or None if text is empty
1: Check if the input string 'text' is empty:
2:     if it is empty:
3:         return None
4: If the string is not empty:
5:     import or use a library that provides md5 hashing functionality
6:     calculate the md5 hash of the string 'text'
7:     return the calculated md5 hash as a string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a: a positive integer, b: a positive integer
Output: an array of even digits between a and b in ascending order
1: Determine the lower and upper bounds
   1.1: If a is less than or equal to b, set lower_bound to a and upper_bound to b
   1.2: Otherwise, set lower_bound to b and upper_bound to a
2: Initialize an empty array named even_digits
3: Loop from lower_bound to upper_bound (inclusive):
   3.1: If the current number is even:
       3.1.1: Add the current number to even_digits array
4: Return even_digits array"
