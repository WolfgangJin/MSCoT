2: Create a list of tuples named value_symbol_pairs containing (value, symbol) pairs for Roman numerals, ordered from largest to smallest:
   - (1000, 'm')
   - (900, 'cm')
   - (500, 'd')
   - (400, 'cd')
   - (100, 'c')
   - (90, 'xc')
   - (50, 'l')
   - (40, 'xl')
   - (10, 'x')
   - (9, 'ix')
   - (5, 'v')
   - (4, 'iv')
   - (1, 'i')
3: for each (value, symbol) pair in value_symbol_pairs:
4:     while number is greater than or equal to value:
5:         Append symbol to roman_numeral
6:         Subtract value from number
7: return roman_numeral in lowercase"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a, b, c: lengths of the three sides of a triangle
Output: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Calculate the square of each side and store them in variables a_squared, b_squared, and c_squared
2: Sort the sides such that c is the longest side (hypotenuse)
3: Check if the Pythagorean theorem holds: a_squared + b_squared == c_squared:
4:     if True:
5:         return True
6:     else:
7:         return False"
"Let's think step by step
Input: s: a string
Output: a modified string based on the given conditions
1: Initialize a flag has_letter to False to check if the string contains any letters
2: Initialize an empty list modified_string to build the result string
3: for each character ch in s:
4:     if ch is a letter:
5:         set has_letter to True
6:         if ch is lowercase:
7:             append the uppercase version of ch to modified_string
8:         else:
9:             append the lowercase version of ch to modified_string
10:    else:
11:        append ch to modified_string
12: if has_letter is False:
13:     reverse the list modified_string
14: join the elements of modified_string into a single string
15: return the resulting string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: text: a string
Output: md5 hash equivalent string of text, or None if text is empty
1: Check if text is an empty string:
2:     if text is empty:
3:         return None
4:     else:
5:         Calculate the md5 hash of text:
6:         Convert the text to bytes if necessary (as md5 hash requires bytes input)
7:         Create an md5 hash object using hashlib.md5()
8:         Update the hash object with the bytes of the text
9:         Get the hexadecimal digest of the hash object
10:        return the hexadecimal digest as a string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a, b: two positive integers
Output: a list of even digits between a and b, in ascending order
1: Determine the lower and higher bounds
   1.1: if a < b:
   1.1.1: lower_bound = a
   1.1.2: higher_bound = b
   1.2: else:
   1.2.1: lower_bound = b
   1.2.2: higher_bound = a
2: Initialize an empty list named even_digits
3: for each digit d from lower_bound to higher_bound:
   3.1: if d is even:
   3.1.1: Add d to even_digits
4: return even_digits"
