Input: a: a string, b: a string

2: Initialize a variable len_b to store the length of string b
3: for i from 0 to len_b - 1:

Input: number: a positive integer (1 <= num <= 1000)
Output: a roman numeral string in lowercase

1: Initialize an empty string named roman_numeral
2: Create a list of tuples named roman_values containing pairs of integers and their corresponding roman numeral strings:

Output: Boolean: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Determine the largest of the three sides:
    1.1: Assume a is the largest
    1.2: If b is greater than a, then set b as the largest
    1.3: If c is greater than the current largest, then set c as the largest
2: Assign the largest to 'c', and the other two to 'a' and 'b' respectively
3: Check the Pythagorean theorem:
