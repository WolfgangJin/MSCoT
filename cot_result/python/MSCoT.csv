"Let's think step by step
Input: text: a string
Output: md5 hash equivalent string of text, or None if text is empty
1: Check if text is an empty string:
2:     if text is empty:
3:         return None
4:     else:
5:         Calculate the md5 hash of text:
6:         Convert the text to bytes if necessary (as md5 hash requires bytes input)
7:         Create an md5 hash object using hashlib.md5()
8:         Update the hash object with the bytes of the text
9:         Get the hexadecimal digest of the hash object
10:        return the hexadecimal digest as a string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a, b: two positive integers
Output: a list of even digits between a and b, in ascending order
1: Initialize an empty list named even_digits_list
2: Determine the smaller and larger number between a and b to handle the range correctly
3: for each number num in the range from the smaller number to the larger number (inclusive):
4:     Check if num is even:
5:         if num is even:
6:             Add num to even_digits_list
7: Return even_digits_list"
