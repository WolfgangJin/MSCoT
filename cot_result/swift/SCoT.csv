Note: The given recurrence relation for odd n involves tri(n+1), which means we need to predict the next value. However, since the sequence is only defined up to n, we need to calculate it iteratively to avoid this issue. The correct iterative approach involves recalculating the condition for odd n correctly without future dependencies. Here's the corrected loop:
11: for i from 2 to n:
12:     if i is even:
13:         Calculate tri(i) as 1 + Double(i) / 2.0
14:         Add tri(i) to tribonacci_sequence
15:     else:
16:         If i + 1 > n:
17:             tri(i+1) = 0 // or some other base case, but usually not needed as the loop ends before i+1 is out of bounds
18:         Calculate tri(i) as tribonacci_sequence[i-1] + tribonacci_sequence[i-2] + tri(i+1)
19:         Add tri(i) to tribonacci_sequence
20: return tribonacci_sequence

However, the simplest way to handle the odd n condition without future dependencies is to simplify the relation to just use known values:
11: for i from 2 to n:
12:     if i is even:
13:         Calculate tri(i) as 1 + Double(i) / 2.0
14:         Add tri(i) to tribonacci_sequence
15:     else:
16:         Calculate tri(i) as tribonacci_sequence[i-1] + tribonacci_sequence[i-2] + tribonacci_sequence[i-3]
17:         Add tri(i) to tribonacci_sequence, ensuring the sequence handles base cases for i-3 properly by extending them with 1 and 3 as needed.

Input: text: a string
Output: a string representing the md5 hash of the input text, or none if the text is empty
1: Check if the input text is an empty string:
2:     If true, return none
3:     Otherwise, proceed to the next step
4: Import the necessary library for md5 hashing in Swift (CommonCrypto)
5: Convert the input text to a Data object
6: Create a variable to hold the md5 hash result
7: Use the CC_MD5 function from CommonCrypto to compute the md5 hash of the Data object:
8:     Initialize a buffer to store the result
9:     Call CC_MD5 function with the Data object, its length, and the buffer
10: Convert the buffer to a hexadecimal string representation of the md5 hash
11: Return the hexadecimal string as the result

Note: The actual implementation of CommonCrypto in Swift requires importing a bridging header and handling the conversion from Data to an unsigned char array, which is not shown in this step-by-step explanation."
