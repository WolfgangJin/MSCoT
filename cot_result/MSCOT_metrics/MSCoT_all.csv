9:         If the new Fibonacci number is less than 2, it is not prime
10:        Otherwise, check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the new Fibonacci number:
11:            If the new Fibonacci number is divisible by any number, it is not prime
12:            If no divisors are found, it is prime, increment the counter
13: Return the current Fibonacci number as it is the n-th Fibonacci prime"
