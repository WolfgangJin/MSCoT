**Explanation:**
- Step 1 calculates the length of the input string.
- Step 2 handles the case where the length is less than 2, which are not prime numbers.
- Step 4 starts a loop from 2 up to the square root of the length. This is because a larger factor of the length would necessarily be paired with a smaller factor that has already been checked.
- Step 5 checks if the length is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is, the length is not prime.
- Step 7 returns True if the loop completes without finding any divisors, indicating that the length is a prime number."

Input: planet1: a string, planet2: a string
Output: a list of planet names between planet1 and planet2 sorted by proximity to the sun
1: Define a list planets in the order of their distance from the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
