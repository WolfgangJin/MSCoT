Output: a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of the number in lowercase
1: Create a dictionary named roman_numerals with integer keys and their corresponding Roman numeral values in lowercase
2: Initialize an empty string named result to accumulate the Roman numeral
3: while number is greater than 0:
4:     for each value in roman_numerals in descending order:
5:         if number is greater than or equal to the value:
6:             Add the corresponding Roman numeral to the result
7:             Subtract the value from number
8: return result"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a, b, c: lengths of the three sides of a triangle
Output: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Sort the sides of the triangle to ensure the longest side is last
2: Assign the sorted sides to variables x, y, z
3: if x^2 + y^2 equals z^2:
4:     return True
5: else:
6:     return False"
"Let's think step by step
Input: s: a string
Output: a modified string based on the conditions
1: Initialize an empty string named result
2: If s contains no letters:
3:     reverse the string s
4:     return the reversed string
5: Otherwise:
6:     for each character ch in s:
7:         if ch is a letter:
8:             if ch is lowercase:
9:                 convert ch to uppercase and add to result
10:            otherwise:
11:                convert ch to lowercase and add to result
12:         else:
13:             add ch as it is to result
14: return result"

Input: text: a string
Output: the md5 hash equivalent string of text, or nil if text is an empty string
1: Check if the input text is an empty string:
2:     if text is empty:
3:         return nil
4: else:
5:     import the md5 library (in Ruby, require 'digest/md5')
6:     calculate the md5 hash of the text using Digest::MD5 hexdigest method
7:     return the resulting md5 hash string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a: a positive integer, b: a positive integer
Output: a list of even digits between a and b, in ascending order
1: Determine the lower and upper bounds between a and b
   1.1: if a is less than or equal to b:
         1.1.1: set lower_bound to a
         1.1.2: set upper_bound to b
   1.2: otherwise:
         1.2.1: set lower_bound to b
         1.2.2: set upper_bound to a
2: Initialize an empty list named even_digits
3: for each number num from lower_bound to upper_bound inclusive:
   3.1: if num is even:
         3.1.1: add num to even_digits
4: return even_digits"
