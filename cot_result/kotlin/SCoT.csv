For the sake of this example, the calculation for odd n assumes the existence of tri(n + 1) as described in the problem, which is not standard. A more realistic approach would be to adjust the formula or the sequence definition."

Input: number: a positive integer (1 <= number <= 1000)
Output: a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase
1: Initialize an empty string to build the Roman numeral
2: Create a list of pairs (value, symbol) for Roman numerals from largest to smallest: 
   (1000, ""m""), (900, ""cm""), (500, ""d""), (400, ""cd""), (100, ""c""), (90, ""xc""), (50, ""l""), (40, ""xl""), (10, ""x""), (9, ""ix""), (5, ""v""), (4, ""iv""), (1, ""i"")
3: for each pair (value, symbol) in the list:
   3.1: while number is greater than or equal to value:
       3.1.1: append symbol to the Roman numeral string
       3.1.2: subtract value from number
4: return the Roman numeral string"

Input: a, b, c: integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle
Output: a boolean value (True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise)
1: To determine if the sides form a right-angled triangle, we need to check if the Pythagorean theorem holds for any permutation of the sides (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
2: We assume a <= b <= c without loss of generality to simplify the comparison
3: Sort the sides to ensure a <= b <= c
4: Check if a^2 + b^2 equals c^2
5:     if a^2 + b^2 == c^2:
6:         return True
7:     else:
8:         return False"

Input: s: a string
Output: a modified string based on given conditions
1: Initialize an empty variable result to store the final string
2: Initialize a boolean variable has_letters to false
3: for each character ch in string s:
    a: if ch is a letter:
        i: reverse the case of ch
        ii: set has_letters to true
        iii: append the modified ch to result

Input: text: a string
Output: an MD5 hash of the text, or an empty string if text is empty
1: Check if the input string 'text' is empty:
2:     If it is empty, return an empty string
3: Otherwise, proceed to hash the string:
4:     Create an instance of the MD5 MessageDigest
5:     Convert the string 'text' to bytes
6:     Compute the hash of the byte array using the MD5 MessageDigest
7:     Convert the resulting byte array to a hexadecimal string
8:     Return the hexadecimal string as the MD5 hash of the input text"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a: an integer, b: an integer
Output: a list of even digits between a and b in ascending order
1: Determine the lower and upper bounds of the range:
   1.1: if a < b then lower_bound = a, upper_bound = b
   1.2: else lower_bound = b, upper_bound = a
2: Initialize an empty list named even_digits_list
3: for each number num in the range from lower_bound to upper_bound (inclusive):
   3.1: if num is even:
       3.1.1: add num to even_digits_list
4: return even_digits_list"
