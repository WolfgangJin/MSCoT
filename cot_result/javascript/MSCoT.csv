"Let's think step by step
Input: a, b, c: lengths of the three sides of a triangle
Output: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Calculate the square of each side and store them in variables a_squared, b_squared, and c_squared
2: Sort the squared side lengths to identify the largest one, which should be the hypotenuse if the triangle is right-angled
3: if the largest squared side is equal to the sum of the other two squared sides:
