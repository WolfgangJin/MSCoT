Input: number: a positive integer (1 <= number <= 1000)
Output: a string representing the roman numeral equivalent of the number in lowercase
1: Create a dictionary named roman_numerals with the following mappings:
   - 1000 -> 'm'
   - 900 -> 'cm'
   - 500 -> 'd'
   - 400 -> 'cd'
   - 100 -> 'c'
   - 90 -> 'xc'
   - 50 -> 'l'
   - 40 -> 'xl'
   - 10 -> 'x'
   - 9 -> 'ix'
   - 5 -> 'v'
   - 4 -> 'iv'
   - 1 -> 'i'
2: Initialize an empty string named result to store the roman numeral representation
3: for each value, symbol pair in roman_numerals:
4:     while number is greater than or equal to value:
5:         Append symbol to result
6:         Subtract value from number
7: return result"

Input: a, b, c: lengths of the three sides of a triangle
Output: boolean: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Sort the sides a, b, c to ensure the longest side is last (c should be the largest)
2: if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side:
3:     return True
4: else:
5:     return False"
"Let's think step by step
Input: s: a string
Output: a string with case-reversed letters or reversed if no letters
1: Initialize a variable `hasLetters` to false
2: Initialize an empty array `result`
3: for each character ch in s:
4:     if ch is a letter:
5:         set `hasLetters` to true

10:     else:
11:         add ch to `result`
12: if `hasLetters` is false:
13:     reverse the order of elements in `result`
14: join the elements of `result` into a single string
15: return the resulting string"

Input: text: a string
Output: a string representing the md5 hash of text, or ""none"" if text is empty
1: Check if the text is an empty string:
2:     if text is empty:
3:         return ""none""
4: Otherwise:
5:     Import the md5 hashing library
6:     Generate the md5 hash of the text
7:     Convert the hash to a hexadecimal string
8:     return the hexadecimal string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a: positive integer, b: positive integer
Output: an array of even digits between a and b, in ascending order
1: Ensure a is less than or equal to b, if not, swap a and b
2: Initialize an empty array named even_digits
3: for each number num from a to b (inclusive):
4:     if num is even:
5:         add num to even_digits
6: return even_digits"
