- Traverse the array and check how many times the current element is greater than the next element (considering the array as circular, hence the modulo operation).
- If this condition occurs more than once, it means the array cannot be sorted into non-decreasing order with right shifts.
- If the condition occurs 0 or 1 times, the array can be sorted with right shifts, so return True."

1: Initialize an empty string named roman_numeral
