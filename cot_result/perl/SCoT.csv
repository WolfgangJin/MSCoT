2:     if the current rotation is a substring of a:
3:         return True
4: return False

Detailed Steps:
1: Initialize an empty list to store rotations of b
2: for i from 0 to length of b - 1:
3:     Rotate b by i positions and append to the rotations list
4: for each rotation in rotations list:
5:     if rotation is in a:
6:         return True
7: return False"

Input: number: a positive integer (1 <= num <= 1000)
Output: a string representing the roman numeral equivalent in lowercase
1: Initialize an empty string to store the roman numeral result
2: Create a list of tuples that map integers to their corresponding roman numeral strings in descending order:
   - (1000, 'm')
   - (900, 'cm')
   - (500, 'd')
   - (400, 'cd')
   - (100, 'c')
   - (90, 'xc')
   - (50, 'l')
   - (40, 'xl')
   - (10, 'x')
   - (9, 'ix')
   - (5, 'v')
   - (4, 'iv')
   - (1, 'i')
3: for each tuple (value, roman) in the list:
4:     while the number is greater than or equal to value:
5:         subtract value from number
6:         append roman to the result string
7: return the result string"

Input: a, b, c: lengths of the three sides of a triangle
Output: True if the sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise
1: Initialize the function right_angle_triangle with parameters a, b, c
2: Sort the sides a, b, c such that a <= b <= c
3: Check if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side:
4:     if a^2 + b^2 equals c^2:
5:         return True
6:     else:
7:         return False"

Input: s: a string
Output: a transformed string based on the given conditions
1: Initialize an empty string named result
2: Initialize a boolean variable has_letters to false
3: for each character ch in s:
4:     if ch is a letter:
5:         set has_letters to true
6:         if ch is lowercase:
7:             convert ch to uppercase and append it to result
8:         else:
9:             convert ch to lowercase and append it to result
10:     else:
11:         append ch to result
12: if has_letters is false:
13:     reverse the string result
14: return result"

Input: text: a string
Output: a string representing the md5 hash of the input text, or ""none"" if the text is empty
1: Check if the input text is an empty string:
    a: if text is empty:
        i: return ""none""
2: If text is not empty:
    a: Compute the md5 hash of the text
    b: Convert the computed hash to a hexadecimal string
    c: return the hexadecimal hash string"
"Let's think step by step
Input: a: a positive integer, b: a positive integer
Output: a list of even digits between a and b in ascending order
1: if a is greater than b:
2:     swap a and b
3: Initialize an empty list named even_digits_list
4: for each number num in the range from a to b (inclusive):
5:     if num is an even digit (i.e., num is between 0 and 8 and num % 2 == 0):
6:         add num to even_digits_list
7: return even_digits_list"
